# 🎮 Python Practice Games

A collection of simple terminal-based Python games built as part of my early journey into programming. These projects helped me learn core Python concepts like conditionals, loops, input handling, and basic AI logic.

> 🧠 Each game was built while following along with tutorials to solidify my understanding of the language and strengthen my problem-solving skills.

## 🙌 About This Project

These games represent my first steps into Python. I followed along with video guides and adapted the code to better understand how terminal games work, and how to build user interaction in code.
